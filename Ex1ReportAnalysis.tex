{\LARGE REPORT \ }\emph{\ \ }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
\end{center}

\textit{\ In this report we want to analyze the method we used in order to
regress two random variables which are correlated with a specific
correlation value and to present the results of the regression. To
accomplish this analysis we used Matlab programming\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ }

\section{\textit{Methodology of generating two random variables with a
specific correlation \ \ \ \ \ }}

\textit{We created two random variables x,\ y which are correlated at 0.1(or
10\%). In more details, we generated a random matrix \ }$M\ $\textit{\ with
2 columns, each column corresponds to the vector we want to derive (the
elements of this matrix are drawn from a standard normal distribution).
Furthermore, we multiplied the matrix with standard deviation and we add the
mean, where variance ( square root of the variance is the standard
deviation) and mean drawn from a normal distribution. Afterwards, we
multiplied M with the upper triangular matrix }$L$\textit{\ which is
obtained using the Cholesky decomposition of the desired correlation matrix }%
$R$\textit{.}

\section{\textit{Regression Analysis}}

\subsection{\textit{Model}}

$y=b_{0}+b_{1}\ast x+\in $\textit{, \ where }$\in $\textit{\ is the error
term.}

\subsection{\textit{Regression Output}}

$\overset{\wedge }{y}\mathit{=}\underset{(0.0307)}{-0.0077}\mathit{+}%
\underset{(0.0308)}{+0.0753}\mathit{\ast x}$

\textit{Moreover, we can observe from our results, that the p-value of the }$%
b_{1}$\textit{, is equal to 0.0148 which implies that this beta coefficient
is statistical significant for }$a=0.05$\textit{. Whereas, the p-value of }$%
b_{0}$\textit{\ is equal to 0.8014 so is statistical insignificant. Finally
the degrees of freedom are 998.}

\section{Summary}

\textit{We can conclude that the estimated correlation coefficient between x
and y is 0.0771 which is smaller compared  to the real correlation
coefficient. }
